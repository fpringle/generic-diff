{- | A worked example of implementing 'SpecialDiff' (and thereby 'Diff') for 'Map's.

We make the choice to prioritise speed over exhaustiveness: in other words we stop when we find
one difference between the two input maps. Alternatively, we could have gone the other way and
enumerated all the difference between the inputs, using some kind of intersection test. This is left
as an exercise for the reader.
